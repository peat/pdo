I'm Peat, and I work with web oriented startups. I'm currently the CTO of <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/">Little Bird</a>, a social analytics and engagement company. Generally speaking, I'm an entrepreneurial software developer, a photographer, a speaker, an occasional cyclist, and a collector of odd hobbies.

Over the last fifteen years I have worked with dozens of startups and investment groups, providing leadership and development for sophisticated web applications, including social travel sites, community blogging tools, scalable content management and distribution tools, identity management systems, social media analytics, custom ERP and CRM, and business process management tools. Amongst other things.

You're welcome to connect with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/peatbakke" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=502808462">Facebook</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/peat">Twitter</a>. You can also reach out directly via email at (<a href="mailto:peat@peat.org?subject=Hello,%20Peat%21">peat@peat.org</a>).

When I'm not working I enjoy travelling, photography, endurance cycling, and collecting paper money. I also enjoy hanging out with local developer groups (notably the Ruby, webdev, and functional development crowd). I have a long standing fascination with rocketry, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdos number</a> of 3, two kids, and a pair of ridiculous pet chickens.

I'm always looking for opportunities to research and speak on interesting topics. Recently I've presented at a variety of conferences on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYECFQ7X4d0">photography in abandoned places</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/peatbakke/serving-the-next-billion">Internet use in emerging economies</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/peatbakke/simpledb-why-what-and-how">Amazon's SimpleDB</a>, and the business of contracting as an independent software developer. If you're looking for a speaker, please <a href="mailto:peat@peat.org?subject=Speaking">get in touch</a>!
