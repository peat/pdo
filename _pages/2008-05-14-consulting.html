I work with startups to plan, build, and scale web applications.  Recent clients have ranged from venture capitalists, to global enterprise-oriented companies, to independent entrepreneurs with a bright idea and little more.  I've helped traditional companies embrace the web to generate millions of dollars in new business, and have led small teams of developers to accomplish big things on tight budgets and short timelines.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Planning -</strong> What technical tools and services will it take to meet your business goals?  I'll help you find the specific technologies that are best suited for your project.</li>
	<li><strong>Development -</strong> Whether it's building a prototype for investors, or developing a release quality application, I can put together a team tailored to your specific requirements.</li>
	<li><strong>Scaling -</strong> Managing hundreds of thousands of visitors takes more than just a new server (or two).  I'll work with you to identify and resolve critical bottlenecks in your application and deployment environment, and help you put together a plan for managing growth.</li>
</ul>
