<a href="http://sun.com/">Sun</a> released a couple of servers based on the new <a href="http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T2/">T2 processor</a> today.   Heaps of people have blogged it, so here's a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/allanp/entry/cmt_comes_of_age">bunch of links</a> to what people are saying.  This one looks like what the T1 should have been -- it was impressive for some targeted benchmarks, but the new chip is a big step up in terms of throughput and floating point performance.
