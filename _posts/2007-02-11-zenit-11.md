Sure, you can find them on eBay for $20 ... but this one has history!  It was presented to my friend by a "high ranking" KGB official while he was doing business in the USSR, about a week before the collapse of the Soviet Union.  It seems to be in perfect working condition -- I'll wander around Munich today and find out.

In other news, we'll be back in the United States on Monday!
