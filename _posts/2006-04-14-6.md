Today's my birthday, and my fine friends and cow-orkers at <a href="http://www.planetargon.com/" target="_blank">PLANET ARGON</a> wrangled some excellent presents:
<ul>
	<li>A bulk pack of blank, white, 3x5 index cards.  Brilliant.  Possibly the most useful and versitile tool ever invented.  Not only can they be used to <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/" target="_blank">Get Things Done</a> and organize day to day tasks, but they can also be folded into paper footballs and/or throwing stars to entertain and/or defend the office.</li>
	<li>A compact <a href="http://www.fisherpen.com/" target="_blank">Fisher Space Pen</a>.  Not only is it sleek and shiny, but it also (apparently) can be used in the boiling, freezing, upside-down, and otherwise exciting environment of <em>outer space</em>.  If the Martians ever get hot for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a>, I'll be ready for the sales call.</li>
	<li>A gift card to the local bakery and coffee roaster that jump starts my mornings.</li>
</ul>
Good times!
