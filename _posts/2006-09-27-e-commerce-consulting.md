This is an exciting year:  My company is growing, our prototypes are working exactly as we hoped, and we'll be rolling out our first public products and services over the next few months.

What's really exciting is watching our clients succeed: they're doing phenomenally well.  In one case, they've seen monthly revenue grow over 2000% -- in 2007, they'll easily clear a million dollars in sales.

Pretty soon we'll be coming out of stealth mode ... and in the meantime, I'm looking for a couple more clients.

I know most of the people who read this site are technically inclined, and quite a few of you have an interest in e-commerce.  So, if you'd like expert guidance on building, managing, and growing a successful e-commerce site, and you're interested in a sneak preview of what we're bringing to market, lets talk.

Call me at (503) 701-4135, or send an e-mail to peat@peat.org.  I look forward to hearing from you.
