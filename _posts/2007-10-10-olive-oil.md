If you've developed a taste for olive oil ... check out <a href="http://www.theolivepress.com/">The Olive Press</a>.  It's amazing stuff.  A friend gave us a bottle of the <a href="http://www.theolivepress.com/store/storedetail.asp?department=Olive+Oils&amp;sku=1011">Sonoma Valley Blend</a>, and it's the best I've had.  If you're looking for a gift for someone with culinary inclinations, this one will go a long way.
