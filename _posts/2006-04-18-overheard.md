<em><a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">TDD</a> makes writing code super easy.  All the hard thinking happens when you’re writing the tests and designing the API, and then it’s just red light / green light when you’re writing the implementation.</em>

Particularly with large projects, building a comprehensive test harness is a fairly cheap way to explore architectural issues without committing to a particular implementation.
