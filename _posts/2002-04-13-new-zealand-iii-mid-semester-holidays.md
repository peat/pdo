<p class="entry-body">This letter is long overdue, so I've made it extra long.  I hope you don't  mind!  Things are well down here in New Zealand.  I'm healthy, I'm happy,  and everything's just peachy.</p>
The first term finished on Good Friday, and now I'm in the middle of a three  week holiday.  The holiday schedule is a bit odd.  I'm not sure why they  chose to give us a three week holiday after only five or six weeks of  school, but I'm not complaining.  The past few days have been quite  exciting:  Poncho and I had a five day tour of the north half of the south  island and the southern tip of the north island.  Lots of fun.

I'm currently staying in Poncho's friend's roommate's room, who's out of  town visiting family.  The dorms wanted to charge me $20 a night to stay  over the holidays, which is a terrible deal, especially considering they  wouldn't even be serving dinner.  I think I like the flatting lifestyle  better anyway -- I don't think I'll be staying in the dorms next year.

Anyhow, the vacation has been quite good.  The first couple of days were  spent being terrifyingly lazy -- wake up around 1pm, spend the day lounging  about in the living room with my temporary roommates, have a few beers with  Poncho and friends when they show up late in the evening, wander off to bed  around 5am, wash, rinse, and repeat.  After a few days of that, we felt a  road trip was in order.  One of our good buddies, Blair, was having his 21st  birthday up in Wellington (on the north island), so we thought it would be  nice to stop by and say hello.

The trip started off easy enough.  Poncho showed up at the door around 10am,  and we went over to another house to pick up our friends Danny and T (short  for JT).  They needed a ride to Richmond, which was a bit out of the way,  but would provide for an entertaining detour.  Instead of leaving town  immediately, we decided that a quick game of paintball would be a nice way  to kick off the trip.

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030308131338/http://www.peat.org/images/big-paintball.jpg"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20030308131338/http://www.peat.org/images/paintball.jpg" alt="paintball" align="right" border="0" /></a> Paintball is an interesting game.  The basic rules are really simple --  don't get hit by marble-sized gelatinous balls of paint, fired from  pneumatic "markers" carried by the opposing team.  Everyone gets a marker  and a mask, and the games are organized around familiar themes such as  capture the flag, or elimination.  The exciting part is that paintballs move  at around 300 feet per second (roughly 200 miles per hour) and leave  impressive welts that look a lot like ringworm.  It's a heck of a lot of  fun.

Anyhow, I decided to document the game, so I brought my camera with me and  wandered around the filed, managing to snag a few action shots of my friends  diving for cover, getting "bunkered," and generally having a good time.   Photographing paintball is almost as exciting as playing it, because trigger  happy people have a tendency to open up on anything that moves.  I think  I'll be building some PVC armor for my camera in the near future.

Paintball finished after a couple of hours, and we hit the road.  The first  leg was rather nice -- we went through some pleasant New Zealand country  side before driving up along the eastern coast.  The coastal drive was a  little slow going, because the road had been washed out in several places by  some big storms in the past few days, but it was still quite beautiful.  The  coast was made of big, jagged, black, volcanic rocks, with rather large  waves crashing over them.  Very impressive looking.

Our first stop was at Poncho, Danny, and T's friend's house.  His name's  Ben.  He dropped out of university this year, because he's making quite a  bit of money importing pearls from China and selling polished shark jaws.   Oh, and he also snapped both of his wrists and a leg last year in separate  freak accidents, which made it rather hard to get to lectures, and  impossible to take notes or write essays.  Ack.  If there is a higher power  in the universe, I can't think of a better way to tell someone that their  life doesn't involve university studies.  Regardless, he's a great guy to  hang out with, and he enjoys paintball, so I think I'll probably be seeing  him again in the future.

After chatting with Ben for about an hour, we continued onwards towards  Richmond, by way of Picton and Nelson, a good three or four hour drive.  By  the time we reached Picton, night had fallen, which made for a long but  exciting high speed ride along the twisting mountain roads to Nelson.   Nelson is an interesting place.  From what I could discern, it's a small  rural town with a bit of a tourism business.  We didn't spend much time  there, because Poncho hates Nelson with a passion.  I'm not entirely certain  why, but I think the story had to do with asshole rednecks with remarkably  unfashionable haircuts.  Regardless, Richmond is a quiet suburb of Nelson,  and is where Danny lives.

We dropped Danny and T off, and headed back to Picton.  On the way, we  encountered a possum.  Not an opossum, but a real possum.  They bare very  little resemblance to one another, as the possum is a very cute little  animal with silky brown fur, but both seem to enjoy wandering out onto  highways at odd hours of the night.  Unfortunately for possums, New Zealand  folks consider them pests, and drivers are instructed to hit them instead of  swerve out of the way.  However, we decided to swerve, and swerve we did,  into the oncoming lane on a blind curve in the middle of the night on a  particularly convoluted stretch of road which happens to be favored by  logging trucks.  But, we saved that confused possums life, so I suppose a  few heart stopping seconds of terror was worth it.

We arrived safely at the Picton ferry terminal at eleven o'clock.  The  ferries don't typically run after 9:30, so we were expected a cold night  camped in the car, but as it turns out, the previous days' storms had caused  a large backlog in ferry traffic, so a high speed ferry was leaving at 1:30  in the morning.  We bought the tickets, hid the car in a nice residential  neighborhood, and spend the next few hours on a big boat with nothing to do  except make up stories convincing the crew that we were Important People and  trying to get cheap drinks.

Armed only with our devastatingly good looks, some impressive looking camera  equipment, and Poncho's "I can sell ice to eskimos" wit, we easily convinced  the crew that we were a couple of journalists traveling through New Zealand  on assignment.  We were doing a follow-up story for "Worth Magazine" on  three American dot-com millionaires who had taken their loot to New Zealand  to start new ventures.

Apparently, flashy American journalists can get away with almost anything  here in New Zealand.  We took group pictures of the entire crew, including  the ship's captain.  We played our music on the ship-wide music system.  We  ran amok and had a great time.  Considering this was a rather large boat,  with room for several hundred passengers, and a few hundred tons of cargo  (not including passengers' cars), we consider our venture a success.  Even  if they were laughing at us behind our backs.

The next few hours are somewhat hazy.  We hadn't slept or eaten much in the  past few days, and after having a bit to drink on the ferry, we were a bit  temperamental and befuddled upon arriving in Wellington.  In the middle of a  nice breakfast, we somehow managed to get into a huge argument about  subjectivism and logic.  Some time later, we were in a very nice office  building, trying to convince a receptionist to let us use their posh  bathrooms, under the guise of having some sort of appointment with their  director or marketing (which actually did the trick).  After that we caught  a bus to Blair's house.  My last memory in the city is riding past the  Beehive, the New Zealand parliament building ... and then the bus driver was  shaking us awake at our stop.  Nice fellow.  We owe him a lot.  Anyhow, to  make a long story shorter, we finally got to sleep around 6 in the morning,  after Blair's mom found us trying to pass out in their driveway (we didn't  think anyone was home).

Blair's birthday party was great.  His parents cooked up a huge amount of  food, and played embarrassing tapes of him singing "If I Only Had a Brain"  from when he was five years old.  Blair's a third year chemical engineering  student who likes to talk about things like thermodynamics, so hearing him  sing "if I only had a bawwwaaain" was quite enjoyable.

The next day, it was back to the south island.  We slept most of the way  across the Cook Straight, then hoofed it back to Danny's place where we did  some more sleeping.  The next morning, having recharged our batteries, we  went out for Nelson Paintball's club day.

Imagine this: you're a reasonable guy (or gal, as the case may be), and you  enjoy a good clean game of paintball -- that is, people yell "HIT" when  they're hit, everyone plays by the rules, the teams are split up evenly  according to skill, and after the game everyone gives advise and accolades  where due.  The "Team Terminator" guys up in Nelson are not reasonable  people, by any measure.  They're a bunch of testosterone pumped hicks who  think that they're hot shit because they have scary looking paintball guns  and wear camouflage.  Yay.  It was Team Terminator against everyone else --  12 jerks who train together and have superior equipment, against 13 of us  with rental guns, eight of whom had never played before.  You can guess who  won.  I can handle loosing, but when they started bragging about how they  kicked our asses and how we should "learn to play good" and use better  equipment ... well ... that's just not cricket, as they say down here.

It sucked, so we spent the night bitching and watching kung-fu movies.  The  next morning, Poncho and I were on the road again, on our way back to  Christchurch.  We took a different route back, through the West Coast.   Absolutely beautiful.  A few hours into it, we stopped for lunch at a little  roadside store.  That's when I realized I had left my shoes at Danny's  house.

The lady who was working at the store was a nice woman, although we think  she may have been a bit lonely.  She talked, and talked, and talked, and  talked.  Wow.  We heard all sorts of crazy stories while eating our pies  (and being eaten by insects).  Apparently, she's originally from Hungary.   When I mentioned I had spent some time in Budapest, she went on and on about  corruption in the government.  As it turns out, she went to England for  college, and spent a fair amount of time drinking with the fellow who ended  up being the current president (or whatever) of Hungary.  Who would have  thought we'd be meeting the Hungarian president's drinking buddy on a  backwater highway in rural New Zealand? Then she gave me a pair of her  husband's shoes, which fit just fine ... but they have a terrible, terrible  funk to them.  Still, it was a very nice gesture.

Anyhow, the rest of the trip was pretty inconsequential.  We arrived back in  Christchurch in time for dinner, and things have been pretty easy going  since returning.  We're heading back to school in about a week, and I'm  looking forward to getting back into the swing of things, although I'm a  little worried about getting "rivered" for my birthday.  It's a tradition in  the hall to chuck birthday boys and girls into the Avon river, which really  isn't much more than a very cold stream with a whole bunch of beer bottles  and duck shit in it.  I can't wait.

On a completely different subject, I started taking jiu-jitsu classes about  a month ago.  There's no particular reason why I started studying jiu-jitsu.    I'm not a very aggressive person, and I've never been in any real fights,  but there was a good deal at a club in town, so I thought I'd try it out.   Now I'm hooked.  Twice a week I hike down to the dojo to get thrown around,  choked, kicked, and punched by my fellow classmates.  Of course, I also have  the opportunity to return the favors -- in fact, just before the road trip,  I managed to give some guy's knee a good bashing with my eye, which promptly  swelled up, went a funny shade of purple, and made me severely nauseous for  about ten minutes.

But it's not as bad as I make it out to be.  I'm hooked because it's fun.   You feel like a super hero the first time you do a basic throw, and your 250  pound partner is easily and gracefully lifted off his feet and deposted at  yours.  Even better, when you do things right, it's easy to avoid the  painful stuff I mentioned earlier -- the incident with my eye was an  outstanding exception to what I've found to be a generally safe sport.  I  leave each session excited to return, and it's a real work out.

A few bruises and a couple bucks are worth it.

Anyhow, tomorrow is my birthday, and I need to track my friends down and  figure out what we're going to be doing.  I hope you're all in high spirits  and good health, enjoying nice weather, and investing lots of time and  energy into my birthday presents.  Heh heh.
