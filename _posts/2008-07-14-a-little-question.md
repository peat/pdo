<em>"What are you doing to change the world today?"</em>

I've asked this question on Twitter almost every morning for the last couple of weeks, and I've received some pretty cool answers from artists, coders, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and the like.  I've had a good response, so I want to cast the net a little wider.

As an experiment, I'm going to interview a few more people over the next couple of weeks, and share their responses here.

Want to contribute?  Want to be interviewed? Know someone who you'd like to be interviewed? Leave me a note and we'll get things figured out!
