<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/">The Google blog</a> has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/were-expecting.html">an announcement</a> -- they've acquired <a href="http://www.tonicsystems.com/">Tonic Systems</a>, and are adding a presentation tool to the Google suite of <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">online apps</a>.  It's due this summer.  I look forward to it!
