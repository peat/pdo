<p class="entry">Why do I have a hard time finding good music? I don’t know. I guess I don’t have the patience to sort through heaps of crap to find the good nuggets. Regardless, every now and then I get lucky and a friend pops something on the stereo that strikes my fancy.

My most recent nugget is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308173902/http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com/">Jack Johnson</a>, a trio with a laid back acoustic sound, somewhat reminiscent of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308173902/http://www.nickdrake.com/">Nick Drake</a>.  A touch of reggae.  A touch of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308173902/http://sublimespot.com/sublime/">Sublime</a>?  I must have heard “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308173902/http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com/main.asp?page=music.asp?Navid=7">On &amp; On</a>” a dozen times without knowing what it was, rolling around town with my buddy <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308173902/http://www.myersphoto.net/">Justin</a>. What can I say? It’s one of those albums I can listen to it straight through without irritation or regrets. Perfect for a long ride in the middle of nowhere with a head full of nothing.

Five stars for anyone with too much goin’ on.
