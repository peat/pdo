"English is a brawling, promiscuous drunkard of a language made up of mispronounced and stolen words from other languages, and that's what makes it such a glory to speak."

-- Cory Doctorow, from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/13/english_mistakes_tha.html" target="_blank">"English Mistakes That Aren't Mistakes"</a>

Update:  12 people found my site this weekend by searching for "brawling, promiscuous drunkard" on Google.  Excellent!
