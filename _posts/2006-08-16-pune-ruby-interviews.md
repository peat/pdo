The <a href="http://www.puneruby.com/blog/" target="_blank">Ruby user group of Pune</a>, India has a blog and is collecting interviews with people about how they discovered Ruby.  It's pretty similar to the "<a href="http://www.urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens/archives/2006/07/the_howilearned.html" target="_blank">How I Learned Ruby</a>" chain letter that's making the rounds, and I'm looking forward to seeing what other people have to say.  It piqued my curiosity about Ruby in India.  I'd love to hear more about how (if?) the language is catching on down there.

So far, interviews with <a href="http://www.puneruby.com/blog/?p=62" target="_blank">Bruce Tate</a> and <a href="http://www.puneruby.com/blog/?p=64" target="_blank">myself</a> have been posted -- and I'm sure there are more to come!
