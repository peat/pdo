Here’s something I keep seeing when digging around on the ‘net and in books, and would like some perspective on:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PERT">PERT</a>.  The Program Evaluation and Review Technique.

Some people say it’s a relic of the Cold War; some people say it’s a good way to quantify how quickly individual milestones in a project can be completed.

What say you?
