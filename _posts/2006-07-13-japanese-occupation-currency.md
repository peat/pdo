What's interesting to me is that they're Japanese currency, but they're printed in English.  Go figure!

Cost:  $5.85, including shipping.

On a technical note, I'm borrowing a friend's scanner to get these online, but it has some odd color banding that's a pain the correct.  Anyone care to recommend an inexpensive flatbed scanner, compatible with OS X &amp; VueScan?  Cheers!
