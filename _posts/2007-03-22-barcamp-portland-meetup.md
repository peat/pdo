The <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortlandMeetups" target="_blank">BarCamp Portland</a> meetup is tonight, from 5:30PM - 8:00PM at <a href="http://jivesoftware.com/" target="_blank">Jive Software</a>.

Be sure to RSVP <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortlandMeetups" target="_blank">on this page</a> if you plan on attending.  I've never been, so I'm not sure what to expect, but rumor has it's a pretty good time.
