Woo, it's been busy.   So busy, I forgot to mention that I'll be in Japan from August 20th through September 1st.  Don't worry, I'll share the fun with everyone.

If you need to get ahold of me, e-mail works, and if you're desperate, you can call my wife (who has an international calling plan).  If you don't have my wife's number ... too bad.  We're on vacation.  ;)
