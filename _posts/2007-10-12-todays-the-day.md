... the Wife and I find out if we're having a boy or a girl.  Or maybe a dinosaur.  Wouldn't that be cool?  My inner nine-year-old is stoked on an Ankylosaur.

That said, fair warning to family members who don't want to know the gender before the stork arrives:  stop reading my blog for the next few months.
