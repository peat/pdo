I don't know how I missed this, but the CTO of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozmo">Kozmo.com</a> started <a href="http://maxdelivery.com/">MaxDelivery</a> ... which is like Kozmo, but with a limited number of products, and a less ambitious distribution scheme.

I still think the basic premise of Kozmo is valid -- satisfying the instant gratification urge by delivering stuff to you in under an hour.  It's just finding the right group of people who are willing and able to pay a premium for commodity items, and who reflexively turn to their computer when they want something.

Hmm.  Sound like anyone you know?
