Just a quick recommendation:  if you're looking for a service that will turn your Photoshopped web page designs into clean, fast XHTML pages ... look no further than <a href="http://xhtmlized.com/" target="_blank">XHTMLized.com</a>.  They provided friendly and prompt service, very fast turn around, clean cross-browser code, and great rates.  Highly recommended!
