They're a hot company here in Portland that makes <a href="http://queenbee-creations.com/categories/55/items">tres</a> <a href="http://queenbee-creations.com/categories/58/items">cool</a> <a href="http://queenbee-creations.com/categories/38/items">bags</a> (amongst other things), and they're growing like crazy.  They desperately needed a new website to support their burgeoning business, and no off-the-shelf e-commerce system could do the job right.  Besides requiring 100% creative control over the presentation of their site, they needed a system for managing retail and wholesale customers, tools to match their manufacturing and fulfillment processes, and a platform that would scale with their business through the holiday season and beyond.

That was <strong>eight weeks</strong> ago, and today they're open for business.  We couldn't have done it without a great client, or the kick ass design team at Fresh Fruit.

Anyhow.  Enough self promotion.  Queen Bee Creations has gorgeous products and is run by fantastic people, and I'm thrilled we were able to work with them on this project.

Cheers!
