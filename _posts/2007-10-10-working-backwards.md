On my evening's ramble 'round the web, I found a link to <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/">Werner Vogels</a>' post titled "<a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html">Working Backwards.</a>"

Basically stated, when he's working on defining a new product, he starts with the press release, and works his way backwards through a FAQ and user manual.Â  Then they actually get around to building it.

It's roughly analogous to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">BDD</a>/TDD software development techniques.

Anyone out there do something similar when coming up with products?
