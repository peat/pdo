<a href="http://eweek.com/" target="_blank">eWeek</a> is reporting that a <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2027825,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594" target="_blank">standard has been submitted</a> for how product data is sent to price/product comparison search engines, like <a href="http://froogle.com/" target="_blank">Froogle</a> and <a href="http://shopzilla.com/" target="_blank">Shopzilla</a>.  This is a good maneuver -- I currently maintain about 20 modules for transmitting product information to these web sites, all of which require regular attention as the submission methods and file formats change.

I'm not going to hold my breath for the implementation, however.  It's a great idea for simplifying the lives of e-commerce developers, but comparison search engines are still immature and extremely competitive.  My guess is that if the standards stick, it'll take a year for it to be really useful for developers -- after the big sites all decide to get on board.

Regardless, I'll lobby for anything that makes my life easier!
