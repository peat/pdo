With <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf</a> in town this week, it's a good time to mention that <a href="http://bluehillsolutions.com/">Blue Hill Solutions</a> is looking for a Sr. Web Developer.

Specifically, we're looking for an organized Rails guru who enjoys coaching others, and can step up to a leadership role in our development group.   We want a well rounded individual with at least ten years of software development behind them -- bonus points for experience with e-commerce, scalable architecture, interface design, testing, and application deployment.

This is a salaried position, with aggressive bonuses, perks, and full health + dental coverage.  Our office is located in a trendy neighborhood in north Portland, with easy access to downtown, great accessibility via public transit, and within walking distance of a variety of good restaurants and coffee shops.  Although we don't pay for relocation costs, we're more than happy to talk with developers from other parts of the country!

Blue Hill Solutions is a start-up with a variety of web-based products, including intranet communication tools and  an evolving e-commerce platform.

Sound appealing?  Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hiring@bluehillsolutions.com">hiring@bluehillsolutions.com</a> with your resume and a description about why you think you might be a good fit.
