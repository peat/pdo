I spent this morning adding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-name">i-name</a> support to the <code>open_id_authentication</code> plugin.  Until it gets merged with the master repository, you're welcome to take a look and tinker with my branch on Github:  <a href="http://github.com/peat/open_id_authentication">http://github.com/peat/open_id_authentication</a>

What is an i-name?  It's an alternative way to identify yourself through OpenID.  Instead of using my DNS based OpenID (<strong>peat.myopenid.com</strong>), I can use my i-name (<strong>=peat</strong>) ... it's a lot shorter, and it's not explicitly tied to a specific company or location.

Interested? Read more about i-names <a href="http://2idi.com/welcome/help">over here</a>.
