Yesterday, <a href="http://novanewcomer.com/" target="_blank">The Wife</a> and I were running errands when we noticed a class of middle schoolers standing in a field near our house.  The teacher was fiddling with a 2-liter soda bottle equipped with fins: a class-built <a href="http://www.h2orocket.com/" target="_blank">water rocket</a>.  We watched as they filled it up, pumped it up, and with a cheer, launched it into the sky.  It was great -- an inexpensive, interactive, and exciting demonstration of physics at work.  Instead of falling asleep over a book, these kids were screaming about the joys of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law:_law_of_reciprocal_actions" target="_blank">Newton's Third Law</a>.

Now that's education.
