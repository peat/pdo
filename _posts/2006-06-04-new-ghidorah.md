I have good luck with computers -- most of the time.

This time, Ghidorah (the MacBook) is now on it&#39;s third revision.  The first one was having strange battery troubles and wouldn&#39;t hold a color profile; the second one was D.O.A. with a busted keyboard; and now, the third ... well, we&#39;ll see.

That said, I had a pretty easy time with the folks at the Washington Square Apple Store.  Instead of making me wait for maintenance, they&#39;ve given me a fresh new laptop after diagnosing the issues, so I&#39;ve had that &quot;Ohh!  New Laptop!&quot; experience three times in the last few days.  It&#39;s been glorious, except for brief interludes of cursing bad hardware.

My only beef is that they tried to upsell me to a MacBook Pro when I mentioned the color profile issues.  Also, it seems strange that they don&#39;t have a good color calibration rig in the store.  With so many professionals depending on color correct displays from Apple, it seems like they could make a tidy sum offering a color profiling service.

Anyhow, I think we&#39;re back in action.
