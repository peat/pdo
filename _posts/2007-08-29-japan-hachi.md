I finally understand how Japan found inspiration for it's rubber monster culture.  Giant cicadas, the size of small children, cling to trees and screech like jet engines.  They're everywhere -- trees, bushes, anything they can grab on to.  They also make a terrific THWAP on bus windows when hit at high speed.  Anyhow, I understand how the combination of gigantic bugs and heat stroke could inspire a national fascination for chitinous creatures of city destroying proportions.
