When: August 28, 11:40 AM (Japan Time)
Where: Hiroshima Memorial Visitor's Center 

Sorry for the break in communication -- we've been wandering around Nara and Hiroshima without a reasonable Internet connection ... but you can expect a series of posts when I find the opportunity to upload photos and copy some of my scribbling from my laptop.  Other than connectivity issues, things have been going very well!
