Hey, more excitement: I moved! Previously, I  was living illegally in a warehouse in  north-west  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991013045640/http://portland.citysearch.com/">Portland</a>. However,  The Man (in the guise of a fire marshal) discovered my whereabouts, and so I&#39;ve  found a lovely two bedroom apartment on the opposite side of the river, in south-east.  The  groovy part about the new place is that I&#39;m slowly converting the larger bedroom into a  studio.
