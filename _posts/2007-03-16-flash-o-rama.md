Something happened in the flash memory industry over the last couple of months, and it kinda freaks me out (in a good way).  Prices didn't just halve on flash memory -- they quartered.  You can get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fexec%2Fobidos%2Ftg%2Fdetail%2F-%2FB000JWTQLI%2F&amp;tag=peatdotorg-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">2GB for under $15</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=peatdotorg-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border:medium none !important;margin:0 !important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, for a USB drive smaller than a stick of Trident gum.

That's not rational pricing.  What happened?  Over enthusiasm on the part of flash memory manufacturers?  If the trend continues, a gigabyte is going to be "throw away" memory by the end of the year, and 4GB (the size of a DVD) will be under ten bucks.

Neat.
