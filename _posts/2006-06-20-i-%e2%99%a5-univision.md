Why pay for premium cable channels to watch the World Cup when you can get all the <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search=goal+soccer" target="_blank">GOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLL</a> you can handle with <a href="http://www.univision.com/portal.jhtml" target="_blank">Univision</a>&#39;s basic cable channel?  It&#39;s great.  I can&#39;t understand what they&#39;re saying, but I&#39;m getting very excited.
