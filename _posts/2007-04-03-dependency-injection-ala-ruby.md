Back in the days when I was a Java developer, there was a really hot meme called "<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html" target="_blank">dependency injection</a>" (also known in some circles as "inversion of control").  The hype was oriented around the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/" target="_blank">Spring framework</a>, which promised to be the next hotness for developing web apps (amongst other things).  It's still around, and doing quite well, but I was seduced by Ruby on Rails before I could really sink my teeth into Spring.

Why am I rambling about this now?  Last night when I was trying to fall asleep, Spring floated through my head and I wondered if there was a similar framework for Ruby.  Lo and behold, it turns out <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/" target="_blank">Jamis Buck</a> constructed a container back in the days before Rails became the web's darling framework.

It's called <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org/" target="_blank">Copland</a>, and this <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org/chapter-1.html#logmethods" target="_blank">one example</a> is enough to make me keep thinking about it ...
