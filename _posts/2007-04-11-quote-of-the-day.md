"One Dutch researcher estimates that there are some five trillion spiders in the Netherlands alone, each of which consumes about a tenth of a gram of meat a day.  Were the victims people instead of insects, they would need only three days to eat all sixteen and a half million Dutchmen."

- Burkhard Bilger, "<a href="http://www.lclark.edu/dept/public/objects/BilgerSpiders.pdf">Spider Woman</a>" (PDF - The New Yorker. March, 2007)
