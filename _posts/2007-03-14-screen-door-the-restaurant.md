If you're in Portland, and you're hungry, it's worth checking out Screen Door.  Southern style, local ingredients, small mix-n-match dishes, great service, good coffee, deserts, and drinks -- it's a pretty fabulous place to go with a few close friends.  It's not spendy (or dirt cheap), but I'm pretty confident you'll leave happy.

Yum.
