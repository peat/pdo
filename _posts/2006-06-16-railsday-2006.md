In about 7 hours <a href="http://www.railsday2006.com/" target="_blank">RailsDay 2006</a> kicks off -- 24 hours of hot <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> development, design, and sleep deprivation.  It doesn&#39;t get much better then that!

I&#39;m part of the Needmore Coffee team this year, and we&#39;re building an app called &quot;Cuppin.&quot;  We&#39;ll be posting <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/54125366@N00/pool/" target="_blank">photos to Flickr</a> and blogging our at the <a href="http://cuppin.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Cuppin&#39; Blog</a>.
