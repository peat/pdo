<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/carbon-neutrality-by-end-of-2007.html">This is encouraging</a> -- Google's energy consumption will be "carbon neutral" by the end of this year.  I'm keen to see what else they can do with the world's largest collection of information about green practices at their finger tips.

They have a <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/green/energy/index.html">Clean Energy page</a> on their site now that details some of their efforts, but it's a little thin on details.  If they want to own up to the efforts they're making, maybe they can publish some impressive figures about how much they're spending, and how much they're saving?  It's an issue that everyone in the computing industry is aware of, so a vague brochure site about Priuses and solar panels isn't particularly interesting ...

Update:  So, there is one fun little page that details how much energy the solar panels are generating:  http://www.google.com/corporate/solarpanels/home  ... turns out it accommodates about 30% of their energy usage on campus.
