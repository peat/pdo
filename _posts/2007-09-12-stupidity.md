<a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20070911/78058645.html">"It is environmentally friendly, compared to a nuclear bomb."</a>

Which begs the question:Â  what <em>isn't</em> environmentally friendly, compared to a nuclear bomb?

I don't like getting political on my blog, but even the premise of this weapon is straight up retarded.
