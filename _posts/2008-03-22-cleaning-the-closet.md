I was cleaning my closet today and found a few CDs with photos on them, including this set.  I had the pleasure of taking pictures with Juno Reactor 2001, when they came through Portland on their Shango World Tour.  Great people, great music, and a hell of a show.

In other news, I miss my Contax 35mm camera and Ilford HP5+ film.
