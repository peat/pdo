More Firefox goodies!  A short while ago I noted the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3247" target="_blank">S3Fox</a> extension for wrangling files on Amazon's S3 file storage service.  Today I found a great extension for managing EC2 machines -- the aptly named <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?entryID=609" target="_blank">EC2 UI</a>.  It's about as simple as it gets.  Very handy!
