<p class="form">For kicks I wanted to see what <a href="http://www.leapfish.com/">LeapFish</a> has to say about the value of peat.org:</p>
<em>It has been determined based on search results that this name may be extensively valuable beyond the scope of the LeapFish.com domain analysis tool. It is recommended that you seek the services of a complete domain appraisal company rather than rely on this estimate. Thank You.</em>

<em>Estimated Base Value: $630.00</em>

<em>Estimated Actual Value: $66,150.00</em>

Shoot.  And I thought the best part about this domain was getting to read a lot of <a href="http://www.peta.org/%27s">PETA</a> e-mail.
