One of my new years resolutions is to make environmental considerations a core part of how my company does business.  I firmly believe that it's our responsibility to leave the world a better place than how we found it, and I know the decisions we make as a business can have a bigger impact than what we do as individuals.

As a high tech company and consulting group, we consume a fair amount of electricity and fossil fuels in the course of doing what we do.  We also buy and use a lot of computer and network infrastructure, which pound for pound consumes considerable quantities of energy and natural resources to manufacture.

The holy trinity of the green revolution is to reduce, reuse, and recycle -- and I think we can add another element to the equation:  offset.  While we can ensure our high tech purchases are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoHS" target="_blank">RoHS</a> compliant and that our vendors offer recycling services, computers don't grow on trees, and neither does the electricity that runs them.  Purchasing offsets from reputable sources is a way to pay back those environmental debts, by financing the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_energy" target="_blank">sustainable energy</a> and raw materials.

It's easy to calculate and buy <a href="https://www.greentagsusa.org/GreenTags/index.cfm" target="_blank">green tags</a> to balance our electrical and fossil fuel consumption -- but I'm running into trouble finding information about how to offset equipment purchases.  Anyone have a handy guide to such things?
