Last month I (finally) switched from <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> to <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a>.  It works great from the desktop or the phone, but the feature that really motivated me to switch is sharing articles that are particularly entertaining or enlightening.

Here's <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/06400738046037039809">Peat's shared items</a>.  You'll probably notice I'm a fan of <a href="http://boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a>, <a href="http://makezine.com/">Make Magazine</a>, and a heap of odd nerdly things.

Feedburner says most of the people who read my blog are also using Google Reader, so if you're sharing articles, I'd love to read 'em!
