If you're looking for a Skype-friendly handset, check out <a href="http://ipevo.com/" target="_blank">IPEVO</a>.  The shopping experience was very simple -- a limited number of attractive products at good prices.  They shipped our order within 5 hours of receiving it, without any special rush delivery instructions.

That wouldn't be surprising if it were a small, eager startup, but that isn't the case -- it's run by a publicly traded business that operates one of the largest <a href="http://pchome.com.tw/" target="_blank">shopping portals</a> in Taiwan.  Good job.

(I'll review the <a href="http://www.ipevo.com/v2/prod/p111444.htm" target="_blank">handset</a> when it arrives)
