<p class="entry-body">I had an interesting discussion about violence tonight. What is violence? How do we precieve violence? It&#39;s an interesting question, especially as someone who&#39;s despises violence, but eagerly plays paintball, and loves studying jiu-jitsu.

Jiu-jitsu was probably the hardest to reconcile with my belief in non-violence. It&#39;s been on my mind for a few weeks now, particularly after the session where I ended up with a swollen eye and severe nausea from being dazed and choked. It was a pretty direct example of the point of jiu-jitsu, which has been developed over thousands of years as a brutally effective way to inflict pain, disable, and kill people -- and only people.

So how the heck can I study it as a pacifist, being conscious of what it is? What does pacifism actually mean to me? Does it mean I&#39;m not supposed to hit people, or does it mean I&#39;m not supposed to <i>hurt</i> people?  When is pain a sensation, and when is it violence?

I used to think that physical pain was the same as violence, but I couldn&#39;t find the violence in sore muscles after a good work out. I also knew that moving to a foreign country and getting to know a bunch of new people would be a somewhat painful experience ... but it wasn&#39;t a bad one, and it certainly wasn&#39;t violent. More directly, if someone else inflicts pain upon me, do I necessarily feel it&#39;s a violent act?

Certainly not. When I get shot in the head with a paintball, or when a sparring partner throws me on the mat, it can be painful, but I rarely feel offended or personally violated; I think it only becomes violence if my boundaries of acceptance are broken without my permission. I know when I walk into the dojo that I&#39;m going to go home with bruises and sore joints, but I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s pushing too far, and I know I&#39;ll be able to stop the process if I become too uncomfortable. It&#39;s a voluntary sport between willing contestants. Within the context of the dojo, I think Jiu-jitsu is safe and enjoyable, and that&#39;s the only place and way I feel good practicing it.

So why didn&#39;t I take up Aikido, or Tai Chi, or another less painful and offensively destructive martial art? I&#39;m not going to be getting into any bar brawls, nor do I have any mortal enemies, so what&#39;s the point of studying a martial art with such violent design?

On one hand, it&#39;s about making choices and demonstrating what I actually believe in. Choosing to avoid a fight when I know I can&#39;t fight is a much, much different choice than avoiding a fight when I know I could end it decisively in my favor. When I have the option, it becomes a personal test of what I believe in -- my maturity, my desires, and how I want to live my life. It also serves a very potent message about non-violent resolution.

On the other hand, it&#39;s about developing ideas to their fullest. If I want to learn about hand to hand combat, then I should learn an effective and comprehensive system. There&#39;s no point in misleading myself, or becoming good at something not suited for what I want. Jiu-jitsu is undoubtedly one of the best offensive and defensive martial arts, so it serves my purposes well.

I guess it all boils down to the idea that even though Jiu-jitsu is of violent design, it can be used non-violently, and because of it&#39;s violent design it can be used as a powerful message of non-violence. Fascinating stuff, for me at least.

I&#39;m really interested in hearing what other people think -- send some email to  <a href="mailto:peat@peat.org">peat@peat.org</a>.
