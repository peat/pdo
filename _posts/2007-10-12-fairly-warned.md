We had the ultrasound, and it's a boy!  With arms and legs and everything!

This ultrasound was way more interesting than the last one (in which he vaguely resembled a dinosaur and/or an omelette).  It's just about the most awesome thing in the universe to see the heart beating (valves flapping away), and watch tiny feet and hands pushing about.  The little dude even flipped us off after we measured his brain size.  Go figure.

Anyhow.  Gender has been clearly determined, and it's kinda funny to watch the social transmission  of our friends and family grinding into BOY mode.  Nova's family is a vast network of grandmothers, mothers, and girls ... so I imagine there's going to be some hand wringing and consternation while adjusting to having a little boy in the family.
