<p class="entry-body">Hello again. It's been a long time since I last updated this site -- too long. Here's the low down: I moved back to Portland. The holidays were good. I've started my business. I'm moving to Germany. Phew. Yeah, things are a little busy.</p>
The move back to Portland was pretty easy. I don't remember much, other than it was a long plane ride, and that the subsequent months have been very, very busy, and quite a bit of fun. It was great to see my family again, and reconnect with all my good buddies in P-town. I think my girlfriend is glad to have me back in town, and our cats have been pretty ridiculous. I think they really like me.

The most exciting thing about being back in town is getting my business rolling. I bought a new kick ass server, and I'm fairly confidient that things will be rockin' pretty soon. At least, I hope they will be. I move to Germany in April, and if I'm not gainfuly employed by my business, I'm going to be in a bit of a pinch.

One of my recent side projects has been building a cat climber -- a 4x4, with some plywood shelves, covered in carpet and sissel rope. I think it's bomb proof. With my Dad's assistance, we built the frame and base over the course of a day. It stands 6' tall, and I think the cats are going to enjoy it quite a bit.

I've also been thinking about compressed air engines.  Hmm.
