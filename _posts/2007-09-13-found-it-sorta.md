When I was sitting in a train station in Japan, I watched a variety show that featured a young guy with a banjo lookin' thing who was dressed in traditional garb ... but produced some SERIOUS TECHNO ACTION with some lady with a flute and a guy with a drum.  It was awesome.

Not being able to communicate in Japanese has put a serious crimp in my plans to find out who this guy was and buy all of the music he's ever made.  So, this evening I was hunting around on the Intertron, and found a few things that get me close ... but not quite there.

First, the thing he was playing is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamisen"><em>shamisen</em></a>, which translated into American means "three stringed, cat skin banjo, played with a spatula."  No joke, it's made with cat skin.

That let me dig up some pretty sweet stuff, like this <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=w5rs7pfZuPs">dueling shamisen video</a>, some <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=LFI7ioIwsHY">hot</a> <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=DurmmxA5QP0">solo</a> <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=qWJrMA3zJ5o">action</a>, a little <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=j9QCQhKyskI">shamisen vs. a DJ</a>, and a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=09vfa4vuHFY">shimsen vs. taiko</a> video that gets pretty darned close to what I heard in that train station.  The common thread in most of the good stuff I found is <span style="display:inline;">Kinoshita Shinichi, who, apparently, has awesome fingers.</span>  This is a promising lead.

Any chance anyone else out there can help me in my quest?

Update:Â  Worth posting again -- the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ8N0Cxhuz8">Hifana Wamono video</a> that planted the Japanese hip hop / techno seed in my brain earlier this year.
