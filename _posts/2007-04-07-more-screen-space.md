I'm a huge fan of my little white MacBook.  I think it's just about the best deal on the planet for a personal computer, laptop or otherwise.  The only thing that isn't so hot is the screen size.  Great for use as a laptop, not so great for sitting at a desk all day.

So I went out looking for a cheap monitor that wasn't totally hideous and rendered text nicely, and I found this:  a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9GZN2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=peatdotorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=374929&amp;creativeASIN=B000F9GZN2" target="_blank">Hanns G 19" widescreen</a>.  No, I've never heard of them before ... but it gets the job done nicely.  I bought it at a local shop, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9GZN2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=peatdotorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=374929&amp;creativeASIN=B000F9GZN2" target="_blank">Amazon has it for $180</a>.  We now have a couple of 'em, one at home on the Mac Mini, and one at work.  No troubles what so ever.

If you need a little extra screen space, and you're not a stickler for color accuracy or incredibly high resolution, it's a pretty sweet deal.
