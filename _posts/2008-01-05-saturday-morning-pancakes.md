What better way to start the weekend than a meal containing chocolate and a half stick of butter?

These are my Saturday Morning Pancakes.  I took the recipe from a little book about pancakes, and tweaked it a bit.  It only takes a few minutes to make the batter, it whups ass all over Bisquick, and it produces enough fluffy pancakes to feed about four people.  Don't have four people?  The batter keeps for a couple of days in the fridge without any trouble.

So, without further ado ..
<ul>
	<li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
	<li>3 eggs</li>
	<li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1 1/2 cups of flour</li>
	<li>1 cup of milk</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
	<li>nutmeg</li>
	<li>chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
Put a pan on medium heat, and grab a mixing bowl.

Crack the eggs into a bowl, and mix in the brown sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Wisk to an even consistency, and then start adding flour and milk in reasonable proportions.  You should be able to continue wisking without blowing out your wrist.

Warm the 4 tablespoons of butter in a microwave until it's a liquid.  Butter melts at an alarming rate in the microwave, so this may only take 5 or 10 seconds.  Wisk the melted butter into the batter.

Grate some fresh nutmeg over the top of the batter.  Just a pinch.  Unless you really like nutmeg.  In which case, have a blast.

The end result should be a golden batter that's about as thick as ranch salad dressing.  If it's too thick or thin, add a little more milk or flour, respectively.  Don't worry too much about lumps.

By now, the pan is hot.   Pour in some batter, and if you can hear it sizzle when it hits the pan, you know you're in good shape.  Drop chocolate chips onto the pancake in whatever arrangement suits your mood.

Voila.  Saturday Morning Pancakes.  Let me know what you think!
