Hot damn, <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/" target="_blank">300</a> is a good movie.   It's a beautifully shot, with great action, and true to the book.  I think the most remarkable part about the movie is how much it feels like a glossy, high quality, graphic novel.  The cinematography, color, contrast, action sequences, costumes, actors, everything -- wonderful.

I also checked out "<a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70017727" target="_blank">The Natural History of the Chicken</a>," a PBS documentary about chickens and their owners.  It was recommended by my barber, a chicken owner, and it didn't disappoint.  Check it out if you're looking for something light hearted, feathery, and a little off beat.
