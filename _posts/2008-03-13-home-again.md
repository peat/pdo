It's cool and rainy today, and we're at home, enjoying the quiet.  The trees in our back yard burst out in leaves while we were at the hospital.  I love serendipity.

Driving home was a little surreal -- starting in a dim hospital room surrounded by wonderful people, then being injected back into the fast paced world where no one else knows or cares about you.  I think I drove a little too slow on the freeway.

We're headed back to the hospital tomorrow morning to follow up on his bilirubin count.  He came out with a big ol' bruise on his head, and little baby livers sometimes can't keep up with the clean up work.  It's an easy treatment if it does turn out to be an issue, so we're not worried -- the only long term issues he might have are re-occurring nightmares about pelvises.

Here's a picture of Mr. Conehead himself.  He's only about 10 minutes old in this picture.  His head has returned to a perfectly normal shape since then.  Amazing, 'eh?
