What are you doing tonight?

Want to watch some <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/2008/06/announcing-ignite-3-presentations/">kick ass presentations</a> about weird and interesting things?

Do you enjoy <a href="http://images.cafepress.com/image/5620209_400x400.jpg">beer</a>?

Do you think free is a (very) good price?

Than <a href="http://igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a> is the event for you, and tonightÂ is the night to get your rear to the <a href="http://mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=9">Bagdad Theater</a>.  The doors open at 5:30, but get there early -- last time we hit capacity and had to turn away a few hundred people, and this time around the early bird tickets were all nabbed within 24 hours.

I'm part of the volunteer team, so I'll helping out with whatever needs help.

If you see me, feel free to say hello!
