I'm headed down to San Francisco for the weekend for three days of nerding at <a href="http://www.iphonedevcamp.org/">iPhoneDevCamp 2</a>, from August 1st through the 3rd.

When it comes to native iPhone development, I'm still neophyte â€” but I'm pretty savvy when it comes to building web apps and web services, so I'm on the look out for projects that might need a little love on the server side of things.

I'm keen on meeting some great people and getting my learn on.  If you're headed to iPhoneDevCamp, <a href="mailto:peat@peat.org">drop me a line</a>!
