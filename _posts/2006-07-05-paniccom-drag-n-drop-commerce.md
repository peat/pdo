Here's another interesting e-commerce shop:  <a href="http://www.panic.com/goods/" target="_blank">http://www.panic.com/goods</a>

Panic makes great Mac software ... and also sell some pretty swanky geek t-shirts.

Although the merchandise is pretty sweet, the drag and drop interface is what sets it apart.  For their layout (big pictures, uniform products, simple navigation) and intended audience (geeks), it's a perfect fit -- an interactive and innovative way to do an "old fashioned" job.
