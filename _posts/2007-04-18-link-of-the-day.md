So, here's one of the best web apps I've seen in a long time:  <a href="http://portland.tourfilter.com/">http://portland.tourfilter.com</a>

It's immediately apparent what it does, the layout is simple and unobtrusive, and the content is easy to pick out.  And, it's useful!  I dig it.

Oh.  And <a href="http://frontalot.com/">MC Frontalot</a> is coming to town on Friday.  Yay!
