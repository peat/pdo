<a href="http://webvisionsevent.com/"><img class="alignright" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 20px;" title="WebVisions 2009" src="http://webvisionsevent.com/pix/pix2009/logo.gif" alt="" width="260" height="53" /></a>I'm very happy to announce that I'm speaking at <a href="http://webvisionsevent.com/">WebVisions 2009</a>.

"<a href="http://webvisionsevent.com/sessions/serving_the_next_billion_4D70/">Serving the Next Billion</a>" is an hour long session about the perspective that people from developing nations bring to the Internet, and how web nerds can help improve the parts of the world that need it most.

Empowering the forgotten people of the world is one of the greatest challenges to humanity, and one I've struggled to reconcile with my profession as a software developer.  But I have hope:  the Internet is converging with billions of people, and it's an unprecedented opportunity for people like me (and you) to connect with and learn from the rest of the world.

I also excited about being featured on a <a href="http://webvisionsevent.com/speakers/">web page</a> in close proximity to <a href="http://webvisionsevent.com/speakers/frauenfelder_mark_JNFM/?redir=Li4vI3NwZWFrZXJfNg==">Mark Frauenfelder</a>.

So, put it in your calendar:  WebVisions runs from May 20th to 22nd here in Portland.  I'll be doing my thing on Friday morning at 9:00, and I hope to see you there!
