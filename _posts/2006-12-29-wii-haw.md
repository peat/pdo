I acquired a Wii two days ago, and now I'm sore all over.  Wow.  I haven't been this excited about video games since the original Metroid.  Other people have written better reviews than I ever will -- I just wanted to let other Wii-endowed folks know they can say "Hi!" by sending me (or the lady) a note on our console: 3402 4700 1845 3070
