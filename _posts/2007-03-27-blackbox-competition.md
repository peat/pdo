<a href="http://www.rackable.com/solutions/concentro.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://wp.peat.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/concentro.jpg" alt="Rackable Systems Concentro data center" align="right" /></a>Looks like Sun's <a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox/" target="_blank">Project Blackbox</a> project has a little competition -- <a href="http://rackable.com/" target="_blank">Rackable Systems</a> has introduced (and is shipping) the <a href="http://www.rackable.com/solutions/concentro.htm" target="_blank">Concentro</a>.  It's a data center in a 40 foot shipping container.  It's tailored to Rackable's server products, with half depth racks and a custom DC power system, but it's intriguing none the less.  With all the hype around "containerized" data centers, I'm pretty sure we'll see a few others join the fray.

Whatever happened to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2005/pulpit_20051117_000873.html" target="_blank">Google's rumored container project</a>?  Was that the genesis of  Project Blackbox, or were all of these companies secretly building these things at the same time?
