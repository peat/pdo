Good times in science land!  <a href="http://makemagazine.com/">Make magazine</a> did an article about <a href="http://makezine.com/05/jamjarjet/">jam jar jets</a> -- basically a simple pulse jet in a jar (technically, a Reynst combustor).  But, I don't have a copy of Make, so I did a little reading at <a href="http://pulse-jets.com/">pulse-jets.com</a> and set out to build one from odds and ends in the recycling bin and a bottle of isopropyl alcohol.

The first few attempts were failures.  I used empty aluminum cans, which are easy to work with (cut apart, join together, punch holes in, etc.), but apparently don't have enough internal volume or geometry to sustain a puttering reaction. Nevertheless, I scared the cats with a few good shrieks and bangs, and the good news about cans is that if you get a bang instead of a whoosh, there's no glass shrapnel.

If someone has built a pop can jet, I'm curious to see how it was done!

Anyhow, I didn't have a jam jar, but I did have a medium sized mason jar.  Punching a one inch hole in the lid, and suspending a few inches of similarly sized pipe inside did the trick.  I get about four seconds of "wuga-wuga-wuga" pulse jet action before it burns out.  It sounds like a busted subwoofer, and it's pretty sweet to see the blue flames dancing around inside at night.  I'm sure I'll get longer runs with a fuel that isn't watered down ... but it works well enough as a party trick!

In other news, high quality ping pong balls will burn enthusiastically without leaving ashes behind.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrocellulose">Nitrocellulose</a>, for the win.

Here's some videos of jam jar jets in action:
