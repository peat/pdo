<a href="http://jyte.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://wp.peat.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/jyte.jpg" alt="jyte.jpg" align="right" /></a>So, I'm watching Myth Busters and noodling around on the Internet while waiting for my laundry .. and I find <a href="http://jyte.com/" target="_blank">Jyte.com</a>.  It's based on an idea that's about as simple as simple gets:  you make a claim ("<a href="http://jyte.com/cl/myth-busters-is-awesome" target="_blank">Myth Busters is awesome</a>.") and people vote yes or no.

What makes it compelling is that it's easy find and socialize with people who share your opinions.  Throw in <a href="http://openid.net/" target="_blank">OpenID</a> for buzzword compliance, and a light weight reputation system, and it's a pretty cool little application.
