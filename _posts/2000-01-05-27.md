Happy New Years!  I spent mine in Whistler and had an amazing time.  5 days of partying, snowboarding, and adventuring. What more could I ask for?  Anyhow, considering the power is still on and my toilet still flushes, I figure I should stop using y2k as an excuse to procrastinate and work on my website a little.
