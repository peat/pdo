<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/"><img src="http://wp.peat.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/omniplan.png" alt="OmniPlan Logo" align="right" /></a>For what it's worth, I recommend <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/">OmniPlan</a> if you're on a Mac and in the habit of taking on fair sized projects with a bunch of people.  The manual is super easy to follow, and it makes the process of estimating and tracking progress a lot easier (particularly if you have a lot of dependencies).  It's about $150, and the trial licenses are limited to a single day (grumble), but it just about halved the time it takes me to do estimates for time, people, and materials.
