When:  August 21st, 5:50
Where:  35,000 feet over the Bering Sea

Holy crap.  I was prepared to spend 10 hours squished between disgruntled sweaty people, but when we handed our boarding passes to the gate attendant, they said the magic words:  "Peter and Nova Bakke?  You've been upgraded!"

Business class.  Hallowed ground of free flowing wine, a menu (a menu!), and lazy-boy chairs of remarkable proportions.

Anyhow.  I'm a big fan of flying.  I'll go cattle class and enjoy it, so long as I have a window seat.  One of the most remarkable things I've ever seen was on a flight over the north Atlantic.  It was the middle of the night -- cloudless, clear, with an extraordinarily bright full moon.  The ocean was frozen, but breaking up.  The ice was a brilliant silver, shattered like a broken mirror in the pitch black water, stretching off into the horizon.  Just beautiful.

This time I'm in the middle row, and all I have to watch is a little TV, playing an uncensored copy of Hot Fuzz over and over again.  Bonus points for showing a rather gory British comedy, complete with an abundance of amusingly coarse language.  Not exactly "beautiful" ... but certainly something special.
