Behold:  the <a href="http://www.zapworld.com/electric-vehicles/electric-cars/xebra-sedan">Zap Xebra Sedan</a>.

It's an electric three wheeled jelly bean ... and I drove one today.   It's more or less like driving a ... three wheeled jelly bean.  Kids screamed with glee when we drove past.  Other drivers looked horrified, or overjoyed.

My parents bought it as a little get around town car, and I have to say, it's perfectly suited for the job.

Fun stuff.
