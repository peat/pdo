This is the first time I've run across something <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/standards/persistent/openid/nac.xml">like this</a> -- Sun has stated in legalese that it will not to use any of it's patents against OpenID.  It's an interesting idea, but how binding is such a statement?  Is this a common occurrence?
