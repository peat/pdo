<img src="http://wp.peat.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/7047365-1.jpg" alt="7047365-1.jpg" align="right" />We're selling our old house -- if you're looking for an opportunity to move to Portland and you're looking for a cozy house in a friendly neighborhood, <a href="http://www.rmlsweb.com/v2/public/report.asp?type=CR&amp;CRPT2=BgUFB2ddDnZdV1xZRFxdwZzFt%2BbmE2gDan4loCZVnw%3D%3D">check it out</a>.

What the listing doesn't mention is that it takes 5 minutes to get downtown, has great public transportation (4 bus lines and the Max nearby), is within walking distance to good Mexican, Thai, pizza, cafes, and generally kicks ass.  I guess "ass kicking" isn't something realtors typically like to promote, but this house has it in buckets.
