It's that time of year again!

<a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly's</a> Open Source Convention (<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/">OSCON</a>) is coming to Portland, and the <a href="http://pdxruby.org/">Portland Ruby Group</a> is putting on <strong>FOSCON</strong>, a <strong>free</strong> event where geeks of all stripes can meet, greet, and get their nerd on.  The last two years were standing room only (don't tell the fire marshal), so we're movin' on up to a larger venue!

If you're coming to OSCON, <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/216872">register today</a> for FOSCON III -- it's free!

PS:  If your business is interested in a little attention from an international crowd of alpha-geeks and decision makers, we'd love to talk with you about sponsorship for food, drinks, and other goodies.
