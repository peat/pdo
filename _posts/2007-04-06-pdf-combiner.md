Thank goodness for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/" target="_blank">Automator</a>.  I whipped out a three step workflow for selecting PDFs, merging them, and previewing the final result.  It seems to work pretty alright, although you gotta name your files alphabetically to set the order they're combined.  Easy!

So, if you think it might be useful, you're welcome to download <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/peat/PDF%20Combiner.dmg.zip" target="_blank">PDF Combiner</a> version 0.1.

On a slightly tangental note, I've hosted the file on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261" target="_blank">Amazon's S3</a> service.  I was looking for an easy way to upload files, and came across <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3247" target="_blank">S3Fox</a> ... a handy and very useful extension to FireFox for doing just that.
