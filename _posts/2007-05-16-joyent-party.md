You know you're having a good time when:
<ul>
	<li>Pitchers of beer outnumber the glasses on the tables.</li>
	<li>It's standing room only.</li>
	<li>The accordion player covers Billy Idol and Guns n' Roses.</li>
	<li>It's nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds!</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a> came to town for <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf</a> and put together a "little" get together at the <a href="http://luckylab.com/">Lucky Lab</a> tonight.  It's a good time reconnecting with friends, meeting new people from around the country, drinking beer, and getting our geek on.  So, cheers to Joyent for sponsoring the copious consumption and bringing people together.

A couple unrelated tidbits:Â  Joyent has some pretty exciting news to be announced at RailsConf ... and <a href="http://grabb.it/">Grabb.it</a> ("the MP3 eating rabbit") has made a lot of progress in the last few months -- it's a pretty kick ass way to find and listen to new music.  Check it out.
