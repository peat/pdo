<a href="http://plurk.com/"><img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="http://www.plurk.com/static/creatures/big/1.png" alt="" /></a><a href="http://plurk.com/">Plurk</a> is the only Twitter alternative I'm excited about.  Why?  Because the interface is fun to navigate, gives a better sense of time and community, and has plenty of visual queues for it's features ... and the people who are building it are obviously having a lot of fun.  Their logo is a headless doglephant, and they call themselves the A-Team.  Never underestimate the power of fun.

They say it's built to scale, but we'll see.  Their growth chart this week looks like an insane hockey stick, but I suspect they're still under 10k users.  My fingers are crossed.  I'd love to see these guys succeed.

In the meantime, you're welcome to <a href="http://plurk.com/redeemByURL?from_uid=16971&check=1271043167&s=1">Plurk me</a>.
