Here&#39;s an <a href="http://www.personaldna.com/" target="_blank">interesting site</a> ... it&#39;s a personality test, but they give you a pretty spiffy graphic that sums up who you are in technicolor goodness.

I am, apparently, an <a href="http://www.personaldna.com/report.php?k=jvaQmRfguLFZOfS-OK-ADDCA-149e" target="_blank"><i>animated leader</i></a>.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m as social as it seems to suggest, but generally speaking it seems accurate.  Unfortunately, the graphics don&#39;t play well with WordPress.  Bugger.

Anyhow.  It&#39;s a fun way to spend a few minutes on a slow night.
