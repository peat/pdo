July was a crazy month.  The start-up company I work for found oodles of investors,  so we&#39;re hiring a bunch of people and gearing up production.  A friend of mine is now  my room mate.  I&#39;ve taken up inline skating.  I&#39;m also working on a photography  website,  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991013045640/http://www.peat.org/xchange/">xchange</a>,  which is in extreme alpha stages.
