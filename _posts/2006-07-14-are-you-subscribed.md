Just a quick note -- if you use an feed (RSS/Atom) reader for my site, I highly recommend using my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/peat" target="_blank">FeedBurner feed</a>.  It splices in my <a href="http://del.icio.us/Peat" target="_blank">del.icio.us bookmarks</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mistermoss" target="_blank">Flickr photos</a>, and it gives me more information about what people are reading so that I can write better articles.

Unfortunately, I can't change the default feed on my site to use FeedBurner, so you'll have to subscribe manually at:

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/peat" target="_blank">http://feeds.feedburner.com/peat</a>

Easy!

Also, if you're just interested in my articles, book reviews, and links about e-commerce, take a look at the <a href="http://bluehillsolutions.com/peatdotorg.html" target="_blank">e-commerce newsletter</a>.
