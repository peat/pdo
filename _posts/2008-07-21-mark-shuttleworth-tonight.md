Mark Shuttleworth is in Portland and will be <a href="http://legionoftech.org/blog/?p=28">giving a talk at the Mission Theater tonight</a> â€” I'm totally pumped about it, and you should be to.  Why?
<blockquote>Mark founded and manages the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Foundation</a>, which aims to produce a high quality desktop and server operating system that is freely available all over the world.</blockquote>
Translation: he created one of the most successful Linux projects out there, with the aim to make computers easier to use, cheaper to buy, and more accessible to the rest of the world.
<blockquote>Mark also formed <a href="http://www.hbd.com/">HBD Venture Capital</a>, a business incubator and venture capital provider and <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical Ltd.</a>, for the promotion and commercial support of free software projects ... In 2001 he formed the <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/">Shuttleworth Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to social innovation which also funds educational and free and open source software projects in South Africa.</blockquote>
Translation: Mark puts his money where his mouth is, and is investing in other businesses that increase the adoption and awareness of open source software.

He's also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TM-34">cosmonaut</a>.  How cool is that?
