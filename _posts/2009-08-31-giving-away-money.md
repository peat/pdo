Want some money?  I've giving it away, to anyone who wants it.  Seriously.

The twist is that you probably won't be able to spend it.  I collect paper money from foreign countries, and I have a pile of money sitting in my office that I'm trying to get rid of. They're duplicates that are already represented in my collection, and since I don't collect the high priced stuff, it's not worth trying to divide up and sell on eBay.

So I'm giving it away.

It's neat stuff.  Paper money from over a dozen countries, spanning the last half century of world history.  It never fails to start conversations with people who are interested in politics, finance, art, or travel.  It beats the crap out of monopoly money.  It's fun to leave in tip jars.  Kids say "whoa!" and "cool!"

If you're interested, send me an <a href="mailto:peat@peat.org">e-mail</a> with your name and address, and I'll send you an envelope with 10 different banknotes in it.  Pretty simple.

Free money, for the first 18 people who want it.  Seriously.

<strong>Update:</strong> I stuffed and sent out a pile of envelopes this weekend.  If you got in touch with me before Friday, you're getting an extra banknote.  Free money, people!  Come get it!

<strong>Update:</strong> All the money is gone, but you're welcome to get in touch if you're interested in the next batch!
