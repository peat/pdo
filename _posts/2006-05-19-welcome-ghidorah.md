All of my Macs since 2000 have been named after Godzilla monsters:
<ul>
	<li>Godzilla, the 400MHz G4 PowerMac</li>
	<li>Mothra, the 600MHz G3 iBook</li>
	<li>Ebirah, the 800MHz G4 iBook</li>
</ul>
.. and now <strong>Ghidorah</strong>, the 1.83GHz MacBook.

My first impressions are quite favorable. The keyboard has exellent action, it’s quite fast, it’s very quiet, and the screen is superb. I was a little worried about the “glossy” finish at first, but it’s a non-issue.

I’ve named it Ghidorah, because it’s the first iBook to <em>offically</em> support multi-head displays.  And it kicks ass and apparently breathes fire if you’re running CPU intensive programs.
