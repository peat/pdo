Are you a web developer?

Do you want to create little apps for the iPhone, but not too keen on picking up Objective-C and Cocoa?

Check out <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/">iUI</a> â€” a CSS/JS framework that lets you write web pages that behave like iPhone native apps.

I built a demo app this morning in about two hours. It's an anonymous micro-forum ... really simple stuff, but fun to play with!
