I ran across this error message when I made a slight mistake when booting an OpenSolaris image on EC2:

<code>Client.InvalidParameterValue: Invalid value 'solaris.indiana' for kernel profile.<br/>Supported values are [default, solaris, <strong>freebsd</strong>].</code>

I've been waiting for this since EC2 was announced.  Anyone have more information on the status of FreeBSD on EC2?
