If you're interested in listening to some really fascinating lectures, check out the <a href="http://www.longnow.org/projects/seminars/podcast.php">Long Now Foundation podcast</a>.  The goal of the Long Now Foundation is to promote long term thinking -- where long term is on the order of 10,000 years.  They've rounded up some really fascinating people, including Peter Diamandis (the X-Prize founder), Brian Eno, the Dyson siblings, Bruce Sterling, Ray Kurzweil, and dozens of others.

There's around 50 lectures currently available.  Definitely worth checking out.
