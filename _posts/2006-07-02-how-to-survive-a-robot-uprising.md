Do you like robots?  I do -- or did!  Now I'm afraid of my blender and refuse to use cruise control.

It's an overview of modern robotics, but with a humorously paranoid twist.  Written while getting his Ph.D. in Robotics, Daniel H. Wilson provides a reasonably thorough introduction to subjects like robot vision, mobility, and surviving getting shot with a laser.  It's a fun read, and the graphic design is enjoyable as well.
