<img src="/images/chirpify.png" style="border: none; margin: 1em; float: left"> I regularly use [Chirpify](http://chirpify.com/) to repay my friends -- bar tabs, friendly bets, split bills, [Tweet-a-Beer](http://tweet-a-beer.com/), that kind of thing. In-stream transactions are a natural extension of the social networking experience, and I think it's a huge opportunity for companies to engage with their customers on Facebook and Twitter.

That's why I'm excited about my next big project: leading the effort to scale the Chirpify transaction platform, as an official member of the Chirpify team.  

It's a solid challenge -- Chirpify is on a hot streak, with expanded payment and interaction features, a new round of investment, and a fat sales pipeline I wish I could talk about (but I'm sure you'll all hear about in the coming months). It's very cool to see how far the system has evolved over the last year, and I'm thrilled to help guide their engineering team through the next big growth spurt.
