This afternoon I had the opportunity to scan some of my German Reichsmarks, dated from 1908 through 1923.  A pretty dramatic example of hyperinflation is the twenty billion mark bill that was only printed on one side.  Check 'em out at flickr, tagged with "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mistermoss/tags/reichsmark" target="_blank">reichsmark</a>"
