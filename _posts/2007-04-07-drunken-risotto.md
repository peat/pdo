I like risotto.  It's easy to make, it tastes awesome, it's cheap, and it has a name that impresses people ("ohh, it sounds Italian!").

This is a particularly kick ass risotto.

Here's what you need:
<ul>
	<li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil.</li>
	<li>3 garlic cloves, crushed.</li>
	<li>1 medium white onion, finely chopped.</li>
	<li>2/3 cup Arborio rice.</li>
	<li>2/3 cup barley.</li>
	<li>1 bottle white wine.  (some for the dish, the rest for the chef -- that's how we party.)</li>
	<li>4 cups chicken stock.</li>
	<li>1 pound ground turkey.</li>
	<li>1 cup parmigiano-reggiano, grated.</li>
	<li>1 cup asparagus tips.</li>
</ul>
First, pour yourself some wine.  Then, put the chicken stock in a small pot to warm up over medium heat.  Separately, in a deep skillet, saute the onions and garlic in the olive oil over medium high heat.  When the onions are a bit transparent and softened up after a couple of minutes, drink some wine, and dump the rice and barley into the pan (plus a little salt and pepper if you're keen).  Mix it up and enjoy the crackle and sizzling for a couple more minutes, then dump in the rest of your glass of wine (probably half a cup or so, at this point).

Refill your wine glass.

When the wine in the skillet has boiled off, ladle in the warm chicken stock until the rice and barley are just covered. Drink some wine, then add all of the ground turkey in little bits.

Stir the rice and barley, add chicken stock, and drink frequently for the next 20 minutes or so.  You'll know it's done when you're out of chicken stock, the grains are <em>al dente</em>, and you have a pretty good buzz going.

Add the cheese and the asparagus tips.  This is when it starts to get gooey, and your guests/roommates/significant other will start wandering through the kitchen more frequently, because damn, it's a good smelling dish.

When the cheese is melted in and the asparagus is bright green, season with ground black pepper, and turn off the heat.  Keep stirring for a couple of minutes, polish off the wine, and viola.  You're done.

This dish supposedly serves 4, but I'm skeptical.  By the time I'm done cooking, I'm ready to eat half of it.
