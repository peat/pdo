I had an interesting idea while talking with <a href="http://jvoorhis.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy</a> and <a href="http://david.planetargon.us/" target="_blank">David</a> about pair programming:  Could the same technique be applied to business processes?

Pair programming can be a really marvelous technique, especially in sections of critical code.  It cuts out the communication lag between writing and review, keeps developers in sync, and helps the people involved stay focused on both the immediate technical issues and the overall architecture.  I have ring-side seats when Jeremy and <a href="http://blog.jasonwatkins.net/" target="_blank">Jason</a> take on a tricky component ... and it's an amazing thing to watch.

Anyhow, back to the original idea:  can this practice be applied to business processes?

To frame the question a little better, lets look at what pairing achieves in the development world:  high quality persistent artifacts, and detailed mutual understanding.  That is, good code that sticks around for a while, and two people who know it inside and out.  From a development perspective, you can't get much better then that.

Can this be applied to sales?  Marketing?  Management?  Food for thought.

I'll write more later.
