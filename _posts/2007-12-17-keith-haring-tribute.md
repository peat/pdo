Here's a little something different to start off the week!

<a href="http://stensoul.com/">Peat Wollaeger</a> (yes, another Peat) posted a video tribute to <a href="http://www.haring.com/">Keith Haring</a>, a great mural and graffiti artist from the '80s who died in 1990 from an AIDS related disease.   It's a short video of a mural being built.

I love Peat's stencil work, and it's not just because we share a name.  If you're keen on seeing more, visit his site at <a href="http://www.stenSOUL.com/">www.stenSOUL.com</a>.  Amazon also carries a book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStencil-Graffiti-Street-Graphics-Art%2Fdp%2F0500283427&amp;tag=peatdotorg-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Stencil Graffiti</a> that has some great photos.  Flickr has a fantastic collection of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/stencil/clusters/">stencil art</a>, and I also have a few shots of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mistermoss/tags/stencil">my own</a>.

Happy Monday!
