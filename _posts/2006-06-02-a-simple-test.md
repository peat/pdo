The last six months have been pretty rough for The Pages o' Peat.  I've been through enough blogging software to choke a horse, including some of my own concoctions ... and here I am, trying something else.  This time, it's a hosted blog at WordPress.com.

I wasn't a fan of WordPress until 1.5 came out a while back.  Now they've moved on to 2.0 ... and it's a heck of an improvement.  The backend is graceful and friendly, and the front end templates are a lot easier to manage.

Anyhow, I'll continue to dig at this thing for a while and see if it sticks.  Hopefully I'll be able to copy in older posts as well.
