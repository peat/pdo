<a href="http://panic.com/">Panic</a>, the mighty fine Mac development gurus here in Portland, have released a new product:  <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>.  It's a text editor specifically geared towards editing web pages.  I've tinkered with it a little, and it's nice ...

<strong>... But the website is just plain awesome.</strong>

No, really.  It's just dripping with gorgeous presentation techniques, and they all fit together like an Italian bespoke suit.  I can't think of a better way to market a web development tool than with a killer web site.

Wow.
