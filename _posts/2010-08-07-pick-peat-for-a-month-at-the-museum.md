I've submitted my application materials, and launched a web site to help bolster my case! Â I want to live in the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago for 30 days, and I'll need your help getting there.

Whether or not you have any interest in science, head over to <a href="http://pickpeat.com/">PickPeat.com</a> to learn more about the program, and let me know what you think.

I want to get people excited about discovering how the world works, and I need your feedback.  If you like what you see, would you pass this on to people who might be interested!

Thanks!
