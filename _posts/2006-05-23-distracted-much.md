The Wife is leaving her job to start a career in consulting, and my projects are heating up, which means The Office will be a little too crowded.

Thankfully, the kind folks at <a href="http://www.lessdistracted.com/">lessDistracted</a> have offered me some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/lessdistracted/">space</a> to set up shop.  There should be good times ahead, rubbing shoulders with the likes of <a href="http://www.tablesturned.com/">Tables Turned</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanhonking.com/">Urban Honking</a>, and a <a href="http://unworkinc.com/">fine</a> <a href="http://www.marverde.com/">selection</a> of <a href="http://www.grabb.it/">creative</a>  <a href="http://www.javan.us/">developers</a>.

In the meantime, my thoughts on e-commerce and supply chains are coalescing into something interesting; I’ve fallen in love with FreeBSD again; and I’ve ordered more RAM for Ghidorah.

Good times ahead.
