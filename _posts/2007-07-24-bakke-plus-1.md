I'm about as excited as I can get -- the doc says we'll have a new family member on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_Year">February 29th, 2008</a>.

We had our first ultrasound last week.  It was really neat.  I'm really impressed with how precise those machines are -- our little blob was a little more than a centimeter long, but we could see and hear a beating heart.

It's about the most amazing thing thing I've ever seen.
