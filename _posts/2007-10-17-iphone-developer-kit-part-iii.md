In February I'll officially run out of reasons to not buy an iPhone.  Direct from the <a href="http://www.apple.com/startpage/">horses mouth</a>:
<blockquote>Let me just say it: We want native third party applications on the iPhone, and we plan to have an SDK in developersâ€™ hands in February. We are excited about creating a vibrant third party developer community around the iPhone and enabling hundreds of new applications for our users. With our revolutionary multi-touch interface, powerful hardware and advanced software architecture, we believe we have created the best mobile platform ever for developers.

[...]

P.S.: The SDK will also allow developers to create applications for iPod touch.</blockquote>
Thanks, Apple.
