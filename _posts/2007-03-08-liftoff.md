White-knuckle startup times are back again.  We've received full clearance to launch <a href="http://bluehillsolutions.com/chattermill" target="_blank">Chatter Mill</a>, and none to soon: today, we're unveiling at the <a href="http://newcommforum.com/" target="_blank">New Communication Forum</a> in Las Vegas.  I'm pretty excited about it, but I'm a little biased.  We have some sparse "glossy" marketing material up on our website, but I'd be happy to talk with anyone who's interested in how anonymous communication can make a big difference in corporate culture.  Hey, we'll even give you a demo.  Just ask.

Onwards!

The New Communication Forum is going to be interesting -- the keynote is by <a href="http://www.evident.com/" target="_blank">David Weinberger</a>, co-author of the <a href="http://cluetrain.com/" target="_blank">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>.  The schedule is chock full of podcasting, social media, blogging, and all sorts of other good stuff.

Things are getting under way.  We're all sitting together in a room, with representatives from some of the biggest companies in the world, who are keen to learn about these sorts of things, and that gives me a lot of hope.
