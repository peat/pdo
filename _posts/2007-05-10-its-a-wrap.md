The event ended this afternoon, so Nova and I hopped on the L and headed to Wrigley Field for a Cubs game.  My first game at Wrigley -- it's a great place.  The Cubs lost, but it was a beautiful day, and we had a good time.

I also learned that it was a polish sausage that lured The Wife out of her vegetarian lifestyle a few years back, on her first visit to Wrigley Field.  She's a purist, and couldn't stand the idea of going to Cubs game without having one.

Baseball does weird things to people.
