The <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a> just released their 373 page report on the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/intranet/design/">10 best intranets</a>.

This is a particularly interesting subject, especially for web oriented startups.  Why?  Big businesses are always looking for better ways to connect their employees with the right resources, and are starting to spend a considerable amount of money on web based tools to make that happen.  It's no small task, but if you have a great idea and you're willing to take on "enterprise" level support and sales processes, there's a <em>substantial</em> opportunity out there.

Anyhow, <a href="http://useit.com/">Jakob Nielsen</a> has posted a <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/intranet_design.html">convenient overview</a> of the report on <a href="http://useit.com/">useit.com</a>, but for those of you who want the really quick stuff:
