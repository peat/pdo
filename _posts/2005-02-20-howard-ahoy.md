I’ve always respected his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308173902/http://www.howardism.org/geekin/">abilities</a> and personal philosophies, so it was fabulous to get together and catch up over dinner, scotch, and a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308173902/http://www.cigars-review.org/cigars/Romeo-y-Julieta.htm">cigar</a>.
