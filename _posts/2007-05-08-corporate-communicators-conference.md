We have a booth and everything.  It's all very official looking.

First impressions -- Chicago is a great place.  Friendly people, clean, good food.Â  Awesome bridges and architecture.  We're staying at <a href="http://hotel71.com">Hotel 71</a>, which has been nice so far.  We flew in on the red eye this morning, so everything has been a bit of a whirlwind.

If you're in town, come by and say hi.  We're in the Hyatt West building -- follow the CCC signs and tell the friendly people at the registration desk that you're a friend of <a href="http://bluehillsolutions.com/">Blue Hill Solutions</a>.  Or give me a ring at (503) 701-4135.
