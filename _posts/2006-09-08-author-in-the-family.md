Looks like the <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> has a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701600.html" target="_blank">writeup</a> of my aunt <a href="http://kitbakke.com/" target="_blank">Kit</a>'s book about Louisa May Alcott, which should be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=peatdotorg-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=%2FMiss-Alcotts-E-mail-Yours-Reforms%2Fdp%2F1567923119%2Fref%3Dsr_11_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">hitting the shelves</a> on September 12th.  Good stuff!  <a href="http://novanewcomer.com/" target="_blank">The Wife</a> is in Boston for the <a href="http://kitbakke.com/site/appearances.html" target="_blank">official book launch</a> and a couple of Red Sox games -- I have to say I'm a little jealous.

So, if you're in or near Concord, Massachusetts, and you're keen on a rather interesting discussion about Miss Alcott, check out the official launch event:

<p style="padding-left:10px;">Tuesday, September 12, 2006, 7:30 pm

Congrats, Kit!
