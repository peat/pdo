I received an interesting e-mail a few minutes ago -- looks like Google bought <a href="http://jotspot.com/" target="_blank">JotSpot</a>, the company that hosts my wikis.  My business more-or-less runs entirely on Google services, so hopefully this will blend right in with the rest of the tools I use on a daily basis.

Smart move.
