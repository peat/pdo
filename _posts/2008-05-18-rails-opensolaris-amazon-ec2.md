Do you have suggestions for what to include in a kick ass OpenSolaris AMI, geared towards deploying Ruby on Rails apps?

I'm working with the folks at Sun to build an Amazon EC2 AMI for Rails developers.  The plan is to put together an environment that makes deploying production Rails apps relatively easy. My inclination is towards a Rails stack that includes Nginx, Mongrel cluster, Capistrano, MySQL and some common gems and services â€” maybe RMagick, and/or ImageScience?  Memcached?

Let me know what <em>you</em> want, and I'll see what I can do about it!
