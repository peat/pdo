The idea of broadcasting my every emotion and/or action isn't particularly appealing, and I'm not too keen on hearing the same from everyone else.  Nevertheless, I love Twitter.  Why?

It's all about the links.  People (usually) don't twitter links unless they're worth reading, so it makes for great reading on a pretty frequent basis.  It's great for filling those odd little five minute gaps in the day.
