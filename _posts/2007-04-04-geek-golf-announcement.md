Well, it looks like enough people were interested in a <a href="http://geekgolf.pbwiki.com/" target="_blank">Geek Golf</a> event, so it's on!  If you're in or near Portland, and you like swinging sticks and drinking beer, this is a pretty good opportunity to get together and have some fun with like-minded geeks.

Head on over to <a href="http://geekgolf.pbwiki.com/" target="_blank">http://geekgolf.pbwiki.com/</a> and RSVP, so that we can make the proper arrangements.

Of course, if you're not anywhere near Portland, you're more than welcome to start your own <a href="http://geekgolf.pbwiki.com/" target="_blank">Geek Golf</a> event!

Please feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions.  My address is in the sidebar.
