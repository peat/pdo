Ever wondered what it's like to read a North Korean newspaper?   Check this out -- "<a href="http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/">People's Korea</a>" is a pro-North Korea paper published in Japan.  You'll find gems like this littered through out:
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';">Noting that the workers of the smeltery have upheld the Workers’  Party of Korea with a pure conscience and a sense of obligation, firmly  maintaining the consistent working class stand and steadfastly abiding by the  principle of socialism even under the difficult and complicated situation, thus  strikingly demonstrating the invincible might of the heroic working class of  Korea, he highly appreciated their life totally dedicated to the prosperity of  the country.</span></blockquote>
Wow.
