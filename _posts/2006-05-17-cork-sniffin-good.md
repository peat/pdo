Hot off the presses:  <a href="http://www.corkd.com/">corkd.com</a> .. yet another wine review site, but with an eye for tasteful design, and (thus far) well written reviews.

On a related note, I’d like to plug the <a href="http://www.hollywoodwine.com/">Hollywood Wine and Espresso Bar</a> in the Hollywood neighborhood in Portland.  To enumerate upon it’s excellence:
<ol>
	<li>Good prices (the tastings are a particularly good deal!)</li>
	<li>Delicious paninis, salads, and other small plates</li>
	<li>Friendly, non-snooty, geek friendly service</li>
	<li>Free wifi</li>
</ol>
