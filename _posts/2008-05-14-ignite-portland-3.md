Looks like the fine folks behind <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a> are <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/2008/05/now-accepting-submissions-for-ignite-portland-3/">looking for speakers</a> for Ignite Portland 3.  This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to share an interesting idea with a theater packed full of enthusiastic Portlanders.  I had a great time presenting at <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/2008/02/here-come-the-videos/">Ignite Portland 2</a>, and can't recommend it enough.
