The good news is that I'm now officially certified.   It's cheap, painless, and useful.

The interesting news is that the <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-12">CPR technique has changed significantly</a> in the last couple of years, and for the simpler:  30 compressions and 2 breaths (regardless of age), don't waste time checking for a pulse, and a simpler technique to find where to push.

Plus, the class was taught by a Marine from Texas who passed his firefighter certifications at 49 and had a belt buckle that could double as a dinner plate.  He told us in great detail that if done correctly, it is highly likely that you will hear terrible snapping, grinding, and crunching during compressions.  You know, bones, tendons, cartilage and stuff.  "That's how you know you're working hard enough."

It was ... awesome.

Anyhow.  Highly recommended.  It's a skill worth having.
