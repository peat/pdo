<strong>Picked a Peck but Not Peat</strong>

Well, I didn't make it to the <a href="http://msichicago.org/">Museum of Science and Industry of Chicago</a>, but it was an inspiring challenge, and I was very surprised by the positive response I got from the <a href="http://pickpeat.com/">PickPeat.com</a> website.  In fact, I enjoyed the Q&amp;A and research so much, I've decided to launch a new site to continue the trend.

Sometime in the next few weeks I'll be yanking the sheets off of MisterMuseum.com.  It's the first step in a much larger scheme to help people get interested and stay engaged with science and art.

Stay tuned.

In the meantime, the MSI "Month at the Museum" project is underway.  They've sequestered Kate, and she's doing a great job:  check out the <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/matm/">MATM blog</a>.

<strong>100 Miles of Wet</strong>

After nine hours of busting ass (quite literally) in the rain, I successfully completed the 100 mile Harvest Century.  It's hard to overstate how thrilled I was to cross that finish line: six months ago I would get winded going up a flight of stairs, and I hadn't ridden a bike more than a couple of miles in over ten years.  I've lost about 25 pounds, and gained a hell of a lot of respect for people who do these sorts of things for fun.  And it is fun -- a lot of work, but a lot of fun.

If I can do it, so can you.  You now have 12 months until the next Harvest Century, and I'd love to see you there.

<strong>Webtrendathon</strong>

I re-upped with Webtrends and I'm working with their R&amp;D group to prototype tools for measuring and engaging with social networks.  Great work, great people, and I'm looking forward to some of their public announcements so that I can talk more about what we're working on.

Have I mentioned that they kick ass to work for, and are actively hiring sales, marketing, engineering, and other roles here in Portland?  If you or someone you respect is looking for a job, <a href="http://www.webtrends.com/AboutWebtrends/Careers.aspx">go here.</a>

<strong>#nopoconi</strong>

I'm doing my best to get out a little more, and one of my favorite nerd meetups is the North Portland Coders' Night, or "NoPoCoNi" for short.  If you're keen to drink beer with software developers (<em>and who isn't?</em>), and you're anywhere near North Portland, come to the Lucky Lab's Tap Room on N. Killingsworth and Concord.
