<a href="http://www.pervasivecode.com">Jamie Flourney</a> has posted an <a href="http://www.pervasivecode.com/blog/2007/11/13/capacity-vs-scalability/">excellent article</a> about what "scalable" means.Â  I've heard so many bad definitions it makes me want to pull my hair out, but he nails it with the statement:
<blockquote><strong>Language performance does not affect whether an application scales or not. It is a coefficient to the cost of capacity.</strong></blockquote>
Succinct and to the point -- and perfectly accurate.
