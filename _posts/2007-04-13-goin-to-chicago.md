We've drummed up a lot of interest around Chatter Mill (our internal communication tool for large businesses), so Nova and I are headed to Chicago next month for the Corporate Communicators Conference.Â  It should be a good time -- I haven't spent much time in the Windy City, and on the off chance that I have a spare evening to drink beer and hang out, it would be great to meet up with some fellow geeks.

I'll be there from May 8th through the 10th, and we're staying somewhere near the Hyatt Regency Chicago.

Any takers?
