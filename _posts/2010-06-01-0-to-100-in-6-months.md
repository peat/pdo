On May 1st, I got back on my bike after a ten year hiatus.

I have a goal: completing the <a href="http://harvestcentury.org/">Harvest Century</a> in early October.   That's six months from couch potato, to riding 100 miles (a "century") in a single day.

I said it, now I have to do it -- and I'd like you to do it with me!

The Harvest Century is a fully supported event, which means the route is maintained, and there are regular rest stops with snacks and fluids, plus beer and BBQ at the end.  There are four routes: a 3 mile fun ride, plus 45, 75, and 100 mile routes.  Fun for everyone, even if you're not gung-ho for the century ride.

As an added benefit, the Harvest Century is put on by <a href="http://cvision.org/">Community Vision</a>, a nonprofit organization that provides opportunities to disabled people and their families.  Your registration fee ($40) is tax deductible.

It's good for you, and the community!

I'm going on Sunday morning rides with people interested in working up to the Harvest Century.  This Sunday (June 6th) we'll be riding between 30 and 40 miles.  We haven't determined the route yet, but if enough people are interested in a shorter segment, we can work out a half-way meet up.

There are five months left to get ready.  Interested?  Send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:peat@peat.org?subject=I+Wanna+Ride!">peat@peat.org</a>!
