<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mistermoss/2136699730/" title="Molotov by mistermoss, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2120/2136699730_1beb33c328_m.jpg" alt="Ignite" align="right" height="240" width="160" /></a>I'm doing a presentation at the Bagdad Theater on the evening of Tuesday, February 5th.  The event, <a href="http://igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a>, is a series of short presentations -- just five minutes each -- about weird, interesting, and unusual ideas.

The official site can be found here <a href="http://igniteportland.com/">here</a>, and the Oregonian had a write up <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/special/index.ssf/2008/01/ignite_portland.html">here</a>.

Pretty cool!

My presentation is about <a href="http://ignite-proposals.pragmaticraft.com/proposals/17">"Beauty in Abandonment"</a> -- it's about photographing abandoned places and things in the Portland area.  I'll also be wandering around, helping people register, find seats, and answering questions about the whole shebang.

Anyhow.  Seats are going fast, and it looks like it'll be a standing room only event (unless, of course, the Super Tuesday primaries thin out the crowd).  If you're coming, or thinking about coming, please RSVP so that we can better anticipate everything that needs to be done to accommodate everyone comfortably:
