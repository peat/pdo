When:  August 26th
Where:  Nara

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mistermoss/1265763130/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1084/1265763130_f3a63c4ff6_m.jpg" align="right" height="240" hspace="15" vspace="15" width="161" /></a>Oh, the deer.  Lots of deer.  Cute, big eyed, white speckled little deer, hell bent on taking food from tourists.  If you have a packet of special deer biscuits (or even if you don't), be prepared to be mobbed by a small herd of nipping, butting, ravenous deer.   Rumor has it that the first emperor of Japan descended from heaven on the back of a deer, in the sacred city of Nara.  Since then, the deer in Nara have grown accustomed to a particularly relaxed lifestyle of lounging about and/or rolling tourists.

Our host in Nara was a gentleman named Kenji, and his wife, Yoshie.  They were energetic and gracious, patiently explaining to us how Japanese showers worked, introducing us to new foods, and guiding us through the history and highlights of Nara.
