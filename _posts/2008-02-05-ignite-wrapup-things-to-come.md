I had a great time, and thanks to the organizers for putting together a great show.

There are a few things I'll be doing to follow up on my presentation:
<ul>
	<li>I'll be putting my presentation into a video podcast, with a little more information about what it's all about and how it's done.</li>
	<li>A bunch of people asked about doing a photo trip to some of these sites -- I'm up for it, although some of the trains and sites were cleaned up or scrapped after I took my original photos.</li>
	<li>For people who are interested in the subject matter, I highly encourage you to dig around on Flickr and Google, and simply drive around the industrial sections of the city.  That's where I get 99% of my leads, and half the fun is discovering things for yourself ...</li>
</ul>
Anyhow.  I'll be posting more photos, videos, and other such things as I have the opportunity.  I'll be out of town for the next week or so, but I'll see what I can pull together from the hotel!

And, to everyone I met tonight -- please send me an e-mail!  I'm excited to follow up on some of our discussions.
