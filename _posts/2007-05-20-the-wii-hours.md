Good times were had on Saturday -- I stuffed my <a href="http://wii.com/">Wii</a> in my bag and took it to the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf</a> parties.  We hit <a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a>'s APPyhour first, but the <a href="http://doubletree.com/">Doubletree</a>'s hotel TVs didn't have external inputs.  WTF is up with that?  When someone's staying in a "presidential" suite, there better be an opportunity to plug in a game console.  Regardless, I did connect with three guys I've been talking with for a long time, but hadn't met in person -- Chris Abad and Matt Browne (<a href="http://integralimpressions.com/">Integral Impressions</a>), and Tim Trautman (<a href="http://foorama.com/">Foorama</a>).

<a href="http://railsmachine.com/">Rails Machine</a> threw down at the <a href="http://redlion.rdln.com/">Red Lion</a>, giving out heaps of t-shirts and prizes (including some sweet Rails <a href="http://www.customcups.net/pimpcups.html">Pimp Cups</a>).  They also had really good meatballs.  But alas, no access to plug in the Wii.

Finally, the <a href="http://www.pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> party at the <a href="http://rockbottom.com/">Rock Bottom</a> proved fruitful -- our kind hosts even went as far as to get us an extension cord for the big screen.  Four person drunken bowling and tennis worked out pretty well until 1:00, when everything wrapped up.

Anyhoo.  Good times.  If you're throwing a party at a nerd conference in Portland, drop me a line and I'll bring over some hot Wii action.
