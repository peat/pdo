I crapped a brick the first time I saw the iPhone, and another when I heard that it wasn't going to be open to third party developers or applications.  I understand their reluctance to let other people's software near their proprietary media platform, but come on -- for the iPhone to be a "revolution," they need the support of the businesses and individuals who are chomping at the bit to write widgets that solve problems Apple hasn't even dreamed of.

Anyhow, I guess the clamor over the last few months has been loud enough to be heard at Apple:
<blockquote>For Jobs, the question of third-party software was now a question of "when" rather than "if:" the main issues now were to protect the phone against crashes and security holes, which he said have frequently ruined the experience for smartphones in the past. Pressure on the firm to change its current, closed-off approach was evident in Jobs' reactionary tone.

"We would like to solve this problem," he said.  "And if you could just be a little more patient with us, we’ll do it."

Yay!
